# DCF Valuation Model

## Overview

Welcome to my comprehensive DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Valuation Model, fully built and automated in Excel. This model is designed for both learning and practical applications—covering everything from scenario-driven forecasting to full financial statement linkage, and finished with clear valuation outputs and charts. It's structured to make adjusting assumptions and understanding impact straightforward, whether you're a student, an analyst, or someone prepping for interviews.

## Model Structure

The file is organized for maximum transparency and ease of use:

- **Sheet Index**: Start here for navigation—each major section and worksheet is listed with a reference.
- **Inputs**:
  - **P&L assumptions**: Centralizes revenue growth, margins, costs, taxes, and more, letting you toggle among Optimistic, Base, and Worst Cases for robust scenario analysis.
  - **BS assumptions**: Enter working capital, PP&E, and other balances—sourced directly into the forecast.
- **Outputs**:
  - **P&L / BS / Cash Flow**: Fully linked, period-wise statements auto-update as soon as assumptions are changed.
  - **DCF valuation**: Classic approach—UFCF projections, discounting using WACC, and terminal value via a perpetual growth model. Everything is calculated and traced transparently.
- **Charts**: Auto-generated graphs for revenue & EBITDA, cash flows, EBITDA bridge, working capital, and DCF decomposition—useful for presenting or sanity-checking.
- **Source Sheets**: Snapshots of all historical & forecasted drivers for tracing or quick edits.

## Key Highlights

- **Scenario-Driven**: Switch between three cases instantly—model flexes so you see sensitivities to growth, margins, and cost drivers.
- **True Three-Statement Model**: All financial statements are interlinked, ensuring accurate impact flows from every input.
- **Professional Output**:
  - PV of forecast cash flows and terminal value split out, with reconciliation to enterprise and equity value.
  - Balance sheet checks and cash-tracing built-in.
- **Presentation Ready**: Clear design, consistent units, and labeled charts make this file ready for interviews, presentations, or direct use in projects.

## How to Use

1. **Open the file in Excel** (works best on Mac and Windows).
2. Use the **Sheet Index** to locate key inputs or outputs.
3. Adjust scenario and driver cells on **P&L assumptions** and **BS assumptions**.
4. Check resulting financials (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), DCF valuation, and charts.
5. All formulas are open—feel free to audit, tweak, or expand.

## Interpreting the Results

- The DCF sheet summarizes PV of UFCF, continuing value, enterprise and equity value—everything flows from your assumptions.
- Charts highlight trends and sensitivities—use these for quick pattern spotting.
- Designed for auditability: all numbers trace back to explicit drivers in the model.

## About This Model

Everything here reflects best practices from investment banking, private equity, and top finance coursework. I’ve focused on keeping logic open, structure clear, and adaptability high. If you find issues, want to suggest improvements, or need something custom, feel free to get in touch.
